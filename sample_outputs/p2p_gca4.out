[P2P (Peer-to-Peer) GPU Bandwidth Latency Test]
Device: 0, Tesla K40m, pciBusID: a, pciDeviceID: 0, pciDomainID:0
Device: 1, Tesla K40m, pciBusID: 84, pciDeviceID: 0, pciDomainID:0
Device=0 CANNOT Access Peer Device=1
Device=1 CANNOT Access Peer Device=0

***NOTE: In case a device doesn't have P2P access to other one, it falls back to normal memcopy procedure.
So you can see lesser Bandwidth (GB/s) in those cases.
